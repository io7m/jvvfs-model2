(** Names in [jvvfs] are specifically not allowed to contain:
- Forward slashes (['/'], ASCII [0x2f]), as this is used as a path separator on UNIX and in [jvvfs] virtual paths.
- Backslashes (['\'], ASCII [0x5c]), as this is used as a path separator on Microsoft Windows.
- A series of two or more dots (['.'], ASCII [0x2e]), as this is a reserved name on UNIX-like platforms.
- Colons ([':'], ASCII [0x3a]), as these are used to identify "drives" on some operating systems.
- Null (ASCII [0x0]), as almost no operating systems permit these in file names.
